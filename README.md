# emocontext-19
This repository contains our code for the paper titled **IIT Gandhinagar at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning**. Camera ready version link will be avilable here very soon.

## Installation

The python 3.6.8 was used and to install all the dependencies do 
```py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Code

There are 2 broad approaches as mentioned in our paper
1. Non Deep Learning Approach

    * SVM
    * Logistic Regressions

2. Deep Learning Approach

    * CNN
    * LSTM-1
    * LSTM-2

## Data
Dataset is explained in [this](./data/README.md) seperate README.
